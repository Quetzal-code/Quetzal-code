Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹,

I'm Quetzal Uzcategui, a passionate Full Stack Developer specializing in React. Currently, I'm actively searching for an exciting role with a forward-thinking company. My primary areas of expertise include creating accessible HTML, implementing modern CSS practices, and maintaining clean and efficient JavaScript code. While React is my go-to tool for JavaScript, I'm always eager to adapt to new technologies.

Although I'm based in Merida, Venezuela, I'm enthusiastic about remote work and open to relocating if necessary, even internationally. Beyond the world of coding, my interests span into the realms of finances, games, and anime. Delving into the intricacies of financial strategies, diving into captivating virtual worlds, or immersing myself in the stories of anime, are all passions that keep me engaged.

I invite you to explore my portfolio to see some of the projects I've worked on.
